 # What is the GOAL?

The GOAL of this "thing" is to answer the simple Question: 

**Would it be possible to prcisely detect a mobile Device over its RSSI signal via TRILATERATION?**




**In this "CODE section" i will place CODE which i use to bring this Engine to FLY...!! It is CODE out from my Experiment and Development.
Please see it as a kind of "SnapShot"..Not final, not Error-Free..More Info I will write in the WiKi beside this Development.**

**More info please get from the WiKi**
